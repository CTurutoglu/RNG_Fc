# RNG_Fc
Renormalization Group (RNG) Theory Turbulence Model Modification with Fc Function

This page shares the integration codes and methods for the RNG k-epsilon turbulence model variant, introduced as RNG Fc, for various CFD solvers. 
Researchers are encouraged to investigate the model in complex flow cases and contribute to its further development.

Thanks!

/!\ Limitations /!\

1- Working fluid must be an ideal-gas.
2- The energy equation must be computed.

Implementation for other commercial and open-source CFD solvers will be added soon...
